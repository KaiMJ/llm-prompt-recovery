      "The third change is the shift in genre from a factual, informative text to a narrative, storytelling text. This is evident in the use of phrases like \"The text is rewritten, the LLM has spun\" and \"The original text, a treasure lost\".\n",

      "The fourth change is the alteration in format from a list of facts to a narrative structure. This is evident in the use of verses and choruses.\n",
